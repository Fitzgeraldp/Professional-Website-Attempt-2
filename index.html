                            <p>Before turning my attention to web development and computer programming. I enlisted in
                                the Australian Army Reserves and commenced basic training in 2010. I completed infantry
                                reserve initial employment module training by 2012. During these formative years I
                                developed discipline, problem-solving, attention to detail, working in a team,
                                resilience and being adaptive to different situations and strategic thinking. These
                                skills I developed as a soldier laid the foundation that springboarded me into the
                                fields of law and web development and computer programming. Since commencing my computer
                                programming studies, the similarities to being a soldier can be seen in knowing how to
                                develop and implement agile frameworks.</p>

                                    and a Graduate Diploma of Legal Practice. I am soon to complete a Graduate

                                <p>In 2015, for the Centenary of Anzac Celebrations, I established a contingent of
                                    Direct-Descendants of Anzac’s to march under one banner on the main Anzac Day parade
                                    in
                                    Mackay. From June 2014 to April 2015, I interviewed over 300 direct descendants of
                                    Anzac’s to form this contingent. Under one banner, I led 100 direct descendants of
                                    Anzac’s in the 2015 Anzac Day Mackay main parade. This was the largest contingent of
                                    people to march apart from the schools. In 2015, I received a "Mackay Pride" Award
                                    for
                                    my efforts by the Mayor of the Mackay Regional Council. This task required liaising
